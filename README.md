## Welcome to Shrubhog's website
I am going to try my best to update this as many times as possible.
It's mainly going to be a concept notesheet as a backbone for my repos, so it won't have much.

I've just started a little template engine for text-based monster fighting.

Time to start working on the thing again.
I've added things. Lots of them.

I'm thinking of creating an incremental game, which is my favorite game style, based on coffee. First, you're a man picking money from his couch, then you decide to buy a coffee machine. Make coffee for your neighbors, expand, upgrade, get a permanent  place, and maybe even split off into a coffee country. But it's just an idea. For now.

Already made the coffee thing a few days ago.
