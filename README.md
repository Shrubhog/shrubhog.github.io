## Welcome to Shrubhog's website
I am going to try my best to update this as many times as possible.
It's mainly going to be a concept notesheet as a backbone for my repos, so it won't have much.

### September 19, 2018
I've just started a little template engine for text-based monster fighting.

### September 29, 2018
Time to start working on the thing again.
I've added things. Lots of them.

I'm thinking of creating an incremental game, which is my favorite game style, based on coffee. First, you're a man picking money from his couch, then you decide to buy a coffee machine. Make coffee for your neighbors, expand, upgrade, get a permanent  place, and maybe even split off into a coffee country. But it's just an idea. For now.
## October 8, 2018
Already made the coffee thing a few days ago.
## November 16, 2018
I've been busy. I've made my first release of the game, [Expresso](https://shrubhog.github.io/expresso), and committed over 60 times to it. Now, it has favicons, but the basic style of the game is still really non-existent.
## November 30, 2018
Expresso features are in a dry spell, so I've been thinking about making another game about leaves. I know it's too late for a game about fall, but a game is a game. Game Idea: 
* You are a kid collecting leaves for a big leaf pile
* You can hire other kids to collect leaves by sweeping up fallen ones, throwing sticks at branches, and shaking trees.
* Eventually, your thirst for leaves becomes so great you harvest whole planets for their leaves.
* You can upgrade your employees' equipment to increase leaf production. (e.g. short stick &rarr; long stick &rarr; ... &rarr; steel plant-sensing boomerang)
* In the end, to ascend (restart the game with perks), you jump in the leaf pile.

I've been thinking about it a lot, and I'm even thinking of adding a tabs with Bootstrap. I have to do it in the beginning, though, because I don't want to have to rip the whole thing apart and put it back together after I've finished the game.
